      <b> Vue 3 Composable Functions: </b> Composables can be used for a wide
      range of functionality, including fetching data from APIs, managing forms,
      and handling user input. By encapsulating this functionality in a
      composable, you can make it easier to reuse across different components.

      <b> Vue 3 Composable Props </b>
      Composable Props allow you to define a set of properties for your
      component, which can be easily re-used across other components. To define
      a Composable Prop, you can use the defineProps function that is provided
      by Vue 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Composable Watch</b>
      To use Vue 3 Composable Watch, you can use the watch function that is
      provided by Vue 3. The watch function allows you to specify a reactive
      object or variable and a callback function that will be called whenever
      the value of that object or variable changes.
