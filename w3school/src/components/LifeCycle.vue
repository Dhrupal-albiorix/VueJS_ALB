      beforeCreate : The beforeCreate hook runs at the initialization of your
      component - data has not been made reactive, and events have not been set
      up yet:
      <br />
      created : The created hook runs before the templates and Virtual DOM have
      been mounted or rendered - you are able to access reactive data and events
      that are active
      <br />
      <p>
        Mounting hooks are often the most used hooks. They allow you to access
        your component immediately before and after the first render. They do
        not, however, run during server-side rendering.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Use mounting hooks if you need to access or modify the DOM of your
        component immediately before or after the initial render.
        <b
          >Do not use mounting hooks if you need to fetch some data for your
          component on initialization.</b
        >
      </p>
      <h3>
        Note: Use created (or created and activated for keep-alive components)
        for this instead. Especially if you need that data during server-side
        rendering.
      </h3>

      beforeMount : The beforeMount hook runs right before the initial render
      happens and after the template or render functions have been compiled

      beforeMount hook is starting to compile and render the HTML template. Vue
      creates a template based on our HTML code combine with the data properties
      and uses this template to create the real HTML code which then is rendered
      as the DOM in the mounted hook.
      <br />
      mounted : In the mounted hook, you will have full access to the reactive
      component, templates, and rendered DOM (via this.$el). Use mounted for
      modifying the DOMâ€”particularly when integrating non-Vue libraries
      <br />
      <p>
        Updating hooks are called whenever a reactive property used by your
        component changes or something else causes it to re-render. They allow
        you to hook into the watch-compute-render cycle for your component.
      </p>
      <br />
      Use updating hooks if you need to know when your component re-renders,
      perhaps for debugging or profiling.
      <br />

      <br />

      <b
        >Do not use updating hooks if you need to know when a reactive property
        on your component changes. Use computed properties or watchers for that
        instead.</b
      >

      beforeUpdate : The beforeUpdate hook runs after data changes on your
      component and the update cycle begins, right before the DOM is patched and
      re-rendered. Use beforeUpdate if you need to get the new state of any
      reactive data on your component before it gets rendered:
      <br />

      updated : The updated hook runs after data changes on your component and
      the DOM re-renders. Use updated if you need to access the DOM after a
      property change:

      <br />
      beforeUnmount<br />
      unmounted<br />
      errorCaptured<br />
      renderTracked<br />
      renderTriggered<br />
      activated<br />
      deactivated<br />
      serverPrefetch
